## Understanding the Many Styles of Beer


### Description
Beer has been around for a very long time. Ever since the begining of civilization people have been brewing away and comming up with new ways to make good beer. For this project I will attempt to understand the quantitative qualities of beer. I have decided to download 73861 beer quantitative observations and 23 distinct features. I will attempt to trim and categorize the 176 styles of beer in this dataset. The goal will be to use data science as a tool to uncover what people are brewing and how they like their beer.
